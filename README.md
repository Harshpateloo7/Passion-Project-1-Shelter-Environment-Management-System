#  Shelter Environment Management System
I have built a Shelter Environment Management System, which is a custom management system developed using the ASP.NET Framework, C#, and MVC architecture. This features the use of Code-First Migrations to create a database, and WebAPI and LINQ to perform CRUD operations. The system consists of three entities.

- Employees
- Departments
- Managers

I have established a one-to-many relationship between employees and departments, where each employee belongs to one department, but departments can have multiple employees. Additionally, I have implemented a many-to-many relationship between departments and managers. This means that departments can have multiple managers, and managers can work in multiple departments.
