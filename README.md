#  Passion Project-1 : Shelter Environment Management System
- Project Idea: I would like to develop a system that manages employees, departments, and managers for the shelter environment. The board of directors can visit the website and view the profiles of all employees, managers, and their departments. Also, the admin of the system can read, delete, and update all the information about employees, departments, and managers.
